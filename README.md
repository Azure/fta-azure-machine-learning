# FastTrack for Azure - Azure Machine Learning (AzureML) Live events

This repo contains the material used for the [FTA AzureML Live](https://aka.ms/ftaLive) events.

## Session QnA

We will start 1-2 minutes after the scheduled time to accommodate those still connecting.

The calls will not be recorded due to the wide audience and to encourage questions.

**Slideless session**: No PowerPoint, we promise! As we update [this repository](https://aka.ms/ftaLive/azureML) you will get the changes straight away.

Please give us your feedback through the [feedback form](https://aka.ms/ftaLive-feedback).
